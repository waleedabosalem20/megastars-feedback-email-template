Features

Responsive layout: Designed for a fixed width of 640px to display correctly on most devices.

Header section: Includes the company logo and a title encouraging users to provide feedback.

Body section: A friendly message asking the recipient about their recent trip, with a clear call-to-action link to submit feedback.

Footer section: Contains company contact details including address, phone numbers, emails, website link, and copyright notice.

Inline CSS: Ensures consistent rendering across all major email clients.

Hosted images: Logo and other assets are hosted online, so they display correctly when the email is sent.

Font Awesome icons: Phone and email icons are included for visual clarity.

How to Use

Edit the template: Replace placeholder text with dynamic data if necessary (e.g., recipient’s name, specific trip).

Inline all CSS: Already done in this template to ensure maximum compatibility.

Host images online: Ensure all images are hosted on a public URL (Postimages, Imgur, or your server).

Send via Gmail or email service:

Use a tool like “HTML Inserter for Gmail” or Stripo/ BeeFree to insert HTML directly into Gmail.

Test the email by sending it to yourself to verify layout, fonts, and images.

Notes

Avoid using local image paths; email clients require publicly accessible URLs.

Keep CSS inline; many email clients strip out <style> blocks.

Font Awesome icons may not work in all email clients. As a fallback, consider using images or inline SVGs for icons.
